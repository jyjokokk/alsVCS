# Instructions for Exercises

## 1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
> Input: "abcabcbb"
> Output: 3 ("abc")
```

## 2. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.

```
> Input: `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
> Output: `[["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]i
```

## 3. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals `[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals.

```
> Input: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
> Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
```

## 4. Linked List Cycle Detection

Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. Return true if there is a cycle, otherwise false.

## 5. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array nums of `n` integers where `n > 1`, return an array output such that output `[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except `nums[i]`.

```
Input: `[1,2,3,4]`
Output: `[24,12,8,6]`
```

## 6. Find All Permutations of a String

Write a function that generates all possible permutations of a given string.

```
> Input: `"abc"`
> Output: `["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]`
```

## 7. Two Sum (with Indices)

Given an array of integers and a target sum, return the indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target.

```
> Example Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`
> Example Output: `[0, 1] // (because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)`
```

## 8. Binary Search Tree Validation

Description: Write a function to determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). A BST is valid if all left nodes are less than the root, and all right nodes are greater than the root.

```
> Input: A binary tree (represented as an array or tree nodes).
> Output: true if valid, false otherwise.
```

```
> Example Input: [2,1,3]
> Example Output: true
```
